# Project-Slideshows
These are the projects I completed during my time at Miami and working for a Department of Defense Contractor. The shown images are not classified. 

Slide Speaker Notes:

Slide 1
This is a powerpoint featuring research projects for the Department of Defense, Air Force Institute of Technology, Resonant Sciences and Miami University. 

Slide 2
Scatterometer designed in CAD and manufactured out of Aluminum. Scatterometer is designed to be able to measure the deflection of signals by different materials. Egg carton foam helps to block out interference from the edges of the apparatus. Arms can be moved to different angles to test a full 180* deflection range. 

Slide 3
Testing and calibrating the scatterometer against known materials. The above graphs show how the signals were reflected against air, plexiglass and a known metal plate. Using these measurements we are able to calculate coefficients that allow us to confirm the scatterometer is working correctly. 

Slide 4
A project for a computer aided experimentation class. Interfacing an Arduino microcontroller with processing to control an independent system. 

Slide 5
A tic tac toe game written in Java where all possible boards and layouts have been created so the computer will not lose, best hope is a tie as based on your first move and subsequent moves  the computer will pick its possible move. 


Slide 6
Using available tools to trap and analyze data on an unsecured network.Able to see all traffic on the network including IP and port numbers. Explores how an unsecured network can lead to viscous attacks. 


Slide 7
Agile Development program where we deconstructed and reconstructed a new app for the Miiamian tribe to help teach and pass on their language to younger generations. 


Slide 8
An interactive maze running from an FPGA and coded in VHDL. 1000 Lines of code with an external display and keyboard as peripherals for the FPGA. 


Slide 9
A 18 ft radome constructed from glass for maximum signal transparency. The tool used was made out of foam and sealed with a polyurethane to keep air bubbles from forming in the layup. The layup bubbled in the large 16 ft section of the radome so we had to grind off 2 of 4 layers and were able to do a wet layup to reinforce the radome and achieve the desired results. Radome is attached to bottom of an airplane to protect electronic equipment. The radome is currently deployed overseas. 


Slide 10
Different equipment used during research and engineering projects. The top left is a 3D radar array that will map radar to a 3D image allowing for better classification and detection of objects. The top right picture is an oven used to cook layups, it uses a pressurized chamber to squeeze air out of the layups while cooking them to create a perfect layup. Bottom left is the apparatus we designed and welded to move the 18 ft. aircraft radome without causing damage to it. Middle Bottom is a million dollar high speed camera on loan from the Air Force for monitoring combustion tests of jet fuel. The experiment itself is not classified but the results are. The bottom right picture is the composite material used to create the radome, it is a 3M product and was only good for one hour out of a freezer.

Slide 11
This is an artificial intelligence and machine learning project funded by the Air Force Institute of Technology. The project was coded in python and was implemented on Jetson Tx1 and Tx2 boards. The boards use gpus for high speed parallel processing. We were able to create a program that successfully intakes images through a camera and analyzes those images in order to identify our target. Program was able to identify objects in under 15 seconds across several different images. 


Slide 12
The code pictured here is tid bits of the code in python that allows us to feed an image through a inference graph that was trained by tensorflow software. GUIs were implemented in python to make program more user friendly and to hide the code from users. 


Slide 13
The evaluation set the inference graph was trained on was sufficient for the tests performed. The evaluation set will need to be expanded for future tests to obtain better accuracy of desired results.
